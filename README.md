## About 創作者/Creators
我們是今年剛從高中畢業的學生，因為嚮往遊戲製作而開始這個計畫，儘管我們對程式和遊戲製作一竅不通，但相信憑著一股傻勁努力往前衝
終究能闖出我們的一片天，從剛開始接觸python就被其簡潔的指令和功能強大的模組深深吸引住了，因而決定用pygame來撰寫這個遊戲。
現階段還在計畫初創期，很多事情還需要摸索和學習，希望有經驗的遊戲開發者和程式語言達人能給予我們指點，謝謝。

We are a group of high school students just graduated this year. This project is founded because we are passionate about making game on our own.
Desipte the fact that we are inexperienced in programming and game development, we believe we can achieve our goal as long as we never give up.
When first meeting python, we are deeply attracted by its simplicity and powerful tools which it provide. So we decide to use pygame module to 
write our scripts of the game.
In this stage, we have just started this programm. There's still so many things which we should learn and discover. If you happen to be a game 
developer or experts in related fields. Please give us some advices and guidance. Thank you!
